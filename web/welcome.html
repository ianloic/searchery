        <p><b>Welcome to Searchery.</b> Thank you for trying out
        this extension. A few things have changed, here's a quick
        rundown of what has happened and where to go from here.</p>

        <p>Your address bar now contains a search icon that you can
        use to manipulate your search settings.</p>

        <div class="screenshot"><img src="bar-icon.png"></div>

        <p>Click on the icon to show the Searchery menu. From this
        menu you can configure what shows up in your awesome bar
        results window, configure which search engines you have
        installed and show or hide the old Firefox search box.</p>

        <div class="screenshot"><img src="menu.png"></div>

        <p>When you start using the address bar you'll see search
        engines and search results show up where they didn't
        before. Since all these different search engines are right
        at your finger tips you'll probably want to manage them
        using the <i>Manage search engines...</i> menu item.</p>
